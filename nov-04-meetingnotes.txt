Assignments and partial assignments: Fixed size vector.
Item at index i is a slot. It is what lab x course indexed by i is assigned to.

Slots are objects.
    - Name (Day, Time)
    - Unique ID
    - mincourse, maxcourse
    - minlab, maxlab

Assignables are objects
    - Name
    - Unique Index/ID
    - Subclasses: Courses and labs
    - Vector: Incompatible relation
        - Array of Index/ID offsets of all other incompatible.
    - Unwanted slots for this assignable (As indices.)

Solutions and partial solutions are objects
    - Assign vector (indexed by the courses/labs, contains slots as indexes)
    - We need to keep track of all the number of lectures and tutorials assigned to a slot
        - Use integer vectors indexed by slots.
        - CSize and LSize

We use a priority Queue
    - Expand Node atop Queue -> Put all children into Queue -> Discard parent. We don't need it.
    - TRIMMING???!?!??! Seems like a difficult problem. We argued about this for a while.

==TODO: System Components==

Parser
Output Printer
Constr()
Eval()

Command line flags:
Eval should be split up into 4 different types.
minfilled, pref, pair, secdiff are the different types
Weighting should specify their weighting on the overall Eval function.

==Some fancy UML code for==
